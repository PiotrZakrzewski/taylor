# Make Taylor Proud of your Team's Estimates
I bet your estimates suck and most of your projects are delayed. Maybe you even gave up on estimating dev-team work since it is futile. Or at least hide time estimates behind story-points. Taylor won't fix it for you entirely, but will accompany you as a dev-team estimate calculator whenever people in suits ask the inevitable question.
[Here is The Calculator Itself](https://share.streamlit.io/piotrzakrzewski/taylor/main/taylor.py)

## Dev Estimate Calculator - Goals
- Think of it as a fancy checklist, it will make sure you are aware of some common sources of delays before you Give The Number
- It will help you get more disciplined in giving the estimates
- Conversation starter about sources of delays (dependency on other teams, fire-fighting, multitasking, turnover ...)

## TODO
- One of the most important (but as of now still missing) sources of delays are external dependencies (external stakeholders, other team that needs to finish a task for you)
- Task ordering within the project, lets say you have an official QA process, it can only start after you finish dev work, this cannot happen in parallel and more importantly QAs and devs are often not treated as fungible (one does not pick up the tasks of another).
- Add uncertainty about the estimation itself (ideas: https://jacobian.org/2021/may/25/my-estimation-technique/)

## Why Taylor and not "Dev Team Estimate Calculator"?
Because of one inspiring historical [Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor) of course.
